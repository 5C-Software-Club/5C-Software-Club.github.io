								<h2>Eco-Campus</h2>
								<br>Point of contact:  <b>Sami Murphy (CMC 21)</b>
								<br>App to:
								<br>1. Incentivize students to opt for sustainable alternatives
								<br>2. Promote environmental awareness/ education
								<p>3. Act as a hub that links sustainability organizations on campus</p>
								<h2>Activity Timer</h2>
								<br>Point of contact:  <b>Berto Gonzales (PO 20)</b>
								<br>ActivityTimer allows you to create timers and folders of timers that accumulate time.  By the end of some amount of time it will compile your info together and tell you about what % of your time you've spent on each thing throughout that length of time.  It should help you fill out evals at the end of the semester! I'll be pushing what I have so far to GitHub soon.  Currently, it is an android project working through firebase, but it would be cool to create a whole suite of ActivityTimer apps that work on all your devices.  This could be a fun way for people to learn Android Studio and Firebase.  Please join!
